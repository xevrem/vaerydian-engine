#+title: Game Notes
* Concept
** Genre 
   Top-down Space Simulation
** Overview
   Player is a captain of a spaceship and adventures throughout the galaxy. The 
   game will perform a deep simulation of the player, their ship, their crew, 
   and the galaxy. The game will have a procedurally generated universe, planets,
   factions, enemies, items, etc. Enemies and NPCs will be given directed AI 
   with behavior trees to allow them to behave intelligently and set their own 
   goals based on their needs, desires, and game state. Everything should be 
   craftable. Stories / plot should emerge through gameplay.
