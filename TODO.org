#+title: Game Notes
* Concept
** Genre 
   Top-down Space Simulation
** Overview
   Player is a captain of a spaceship and adventures throughout the galaxy. The 
   game will perform a deep simulation of the player, their ship, their crew, 
   and the galaxy. The game will have a procedurally generated universe, planets,
   factions, enemies, items, etc. Enemies and NPCs will be given directed AI 
   with behavior trees to allow them to behave intelligently and set their own 
   goals based on their needs, desires, and game state. Everything should be 
   craftable. Stories / plot should emerge through gameplay. 
** Gameplay Loops
*** Pimary Loop
    travel between locations (systems, planets, asteroids, etc.) and defeat 
    enemy ships, gain loot, find crew, become more powerful. 
*** Secondary Loop 
    Get tips on locations from space stations. crew and equipment improve your ship, repair damage, spot
    enemies and spot/hear about interesting things, help find tips, etc.
*** Tertiary Loop
    crafting and exploration
